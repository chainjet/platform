# Campaigns

Campaigns in ChainJet allow you to send messages to all your users or a segment of your users. You can use Campaigns to send newsletters or updates directly to your user's wallets.

In order to send a campaign, you first need to import your users as contacts. You can import your contacts with a list of wallets or from an external source, including POAP holders, Lens followers, and more.
