### How to Connect your Discord Server 

To use the Discord integration, take into account that you will need a Discord server on which you are an administrator.

After selecting Discord Integration, you have to click on Connect Discord account and choose a server. Click on continue, grant the ChainJet bot the required permissions, and authorize it.

### Give format to Discord texts

For Discord format, you don’t need to choose a formatting option, you just need to write the Markdown symbols directly into the text box. These are some of the formats you can incorporate to your texts:

*   Italics: Put an **asterisk (\*)** at the start and end of the text.
*   Bold: Put **two asterisks (\*\*)** at the start and end of the text.
*   Underline: Put **two underscores (\_\_)** at the start and end of the text.
*   Strikethrough: Put **two tildes (~~)** at the start and end of the text.
