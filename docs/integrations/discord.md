## How to Connect your Discord Server\*\* &#x20;

To use the Discord integration, take into account that you will need a Discord server on which you are an administrator.

## Give format to Discord texts

For Discord format, you don’t need to choose a formatting option, you just need to write the Markdown symbols directly into the text box. These are some of the formats you can incorporate to your texts:

* Italics: Put an **asterisk (\*)** at the start and end of the text.
* Bold: Put **two asterisks (\*\*)** at the start and end of the text.
* Underline: Put **two underscores (\_\_)** at the start and end of the text.
* Strikethrough: Put **two tildes (\~\~)** at the start and end of the text.
