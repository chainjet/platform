Allowed values include:\n`push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`.\n\nDifferent kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:\n\n* `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be\n  specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is\n  denied for everybody.\n* `force` can not be specified in a Mercurial repository.\n\nThe restriction applies to all branches that match. There are\ntwo ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:\n\n1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in\n   `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every\n   other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match\n   `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all\n   branches.\n2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's\n   branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch\n   to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,\n   `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.\n\nThe combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that\ntwo `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and\n`pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a\nrepository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.\n\n`users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from\nthe restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and\n`restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user\npushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a\nmember of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user\nmerging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in\n`users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or\ngroups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.\n\nNote that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,\nbut the resulting behavior may be surprising.",

        "description": "Update the branching model configuration for a repository.\n\nThe `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to\ntrack the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must\ncurrently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a\n`development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.\n\nIt is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This\nhappens when it points at a specific branch that has been\ndeleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is\nnot possible to update the settings for `development` if that\nwould leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be\nrejected.\n\nThe `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main\nbranch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently\nexist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or\ndisable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a\n`production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.\n\nIt is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This\nhappens when it points at a specific branch that has been\ndeleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A\nrequest that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be\nrejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if\nit would also be left disabled.\n\nThe `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.\nOnly the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be\nrejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.\nFor branch types this means that:\n\n1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,\n   it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.\n2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another\n   enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily\n   classified by its prefix unambiguously.\n\nIt is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be\nleft disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must\nhave a `kind` property to identify it.\n\nExample Body:\n\n```\n    {\n      \"development\": {\n        \"use_mainbranch\": true\n      },\n      \"production\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"use_mainbranch\": false,\n        \"name\": \"production\"\n      },\n      \"branch_types\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"bugfix\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"bugfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"feature\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"feature/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"hotfix\",\n          \"prefix\": \"hotfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"release\",\n          \"enabled\": false,\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n```",

For example,\n`My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.\n\nYou need contributor access to create new forks within a workspace.\n\n\n## Change the properties of a new fork\n\nBy default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.\nHowever, since the optional POST body document follows the normal\n`repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's\nproperties.\n\nProperties that can be overridden include:\n\n* description\n* fork_policy\n* language\n* mainbranch\n* is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit\n  the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)\n* has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --\n  note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue\n  tracker are not copied during forking)\n* has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --\n  note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not\n  copied during forking)\n* project (when forking into a private project, the fork's `is_private`\n  must be `true`)\n\nProperties that cannot be modified include:\n\n* scm\n* parent\n* full_name",

The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n  -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag\nYou can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).\nThe specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference.\n\nThe following reference types are supported:\n\n* `branch`\n* `named_branch`\n* `bookmark`\n * `tag`\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n  -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956\"\n      },\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit\nYou can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.\nIn addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition.

The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n     \"target\": {\n      \"commit\": {\n         \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\",\n         \"type\":\"commit\"\n       },\n       \"selector\": {\n          \"type\": \"custom\",\n          \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\"\n       },\n       \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n       \"ref_name\": \"master\",\n       \"ref_type\": \"branch\"\n     }\n  }'\n```\n\n\n# Trigger a custom pipeline with variables\nIn addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured).\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\",\n      \"selector\": {\n        \"type\": \"custom\",\n        \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"variables\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"var1key\",\n        \"value\": \"var1value\",\n        \"secured\": true\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"var2key\",\n        \"value\": \"var2value\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }'\n```\n\n# Trigger a pull request pipeline\n\nYou can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n\t\"target\": {\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_pullrequest_target\",\n\t  \"source\": \"pull-request-branch\",\n      \"destination\": \"master\",\n      \"destination_commit\": {\n      \t \"hash\" : \"9f848b7\"\n      },\n      \"commit\": {\n      \t\"hash\" : \"1a372fc\"\n      },\n      \"pullrequest\" : {\n      \t\"id\" : \"3\"\n      },\n\t  \"selector\": {\n        \"type\": \"pull-requests\",\n        \"pattern\": \"**\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n",

        "description": "This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by\nuploading files.\n\nTo add a new file to a repository:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \\\n  -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png\n```\n\nThis will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the\ncontents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the\n`image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.\n\nTo create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \\\n  -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \\\n  -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt\n```\n\nYou can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a\nfile by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.\n\nThis endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),\nas well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\n## multipart/form-data\n\nA `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of \"form fields\" that\nidentify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as\nadditional, optional meta data.\n\nFiles are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a\n`Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote\npath in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field\nnames are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the\nrepository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the\nabove `curl` example did).\n\nFile contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.\n\nThe commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the\nrequest, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields\nshare the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`\nbodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the\n`Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to\ndistinguish between a file named \"message\" and the commit message field.\n\n## application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nIt is also possible to upload new files using a simple\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when\nuploading pure text files:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \\\n  --data-urlencode \"/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum.\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"message=Initial commit\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>\"\n```\n\nThere could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file\nnamed \"message\", as this filename clashes with the meta data property\nfor the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names\nclash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,\ne.g. `curl --data-urlencode \"/message=file contents\"`.\n\nWhen an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of\na meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a\nfile.\n\n## Executables and links\n\nWhile this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is\npossible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new\nsymlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.\n\nFiles can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the\n`Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable\nfile, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:\n\n```\n--===============1438169132528273974==\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: \"bin/shutdown.sh\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"shutdown.sh\"; x-attributes:\"executable\"\n\n#!/bin/sh\nhalt\n\n--===============1438169132528273974==\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: \"/README.txt\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"README.txt\"; x-attributes:\"link\"\n\nREADME\n--===============1438169132528273974==--\n```\n\nLinks are files that contain the target path and have\n`x-attributes:\"link\"` set.\n\nWhen overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded\nfile determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That\nmeans uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes=\"link\"` will\ncreate a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at\nthe same path.\n\nThe same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable\nfile, the form-data file element must include\n`x-attributes=\"executable\"` in order to preserve the executable status\nof the file.\n\nNote that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of\nsubrepos / submodules.",

        "description": "This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,\nor the contents of a directory at a specified revision.\n\n## Raw file contents\n\nWhen `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.\nThe response's Content-Type is derived from the filename\nextension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed\nand no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no\ncharacter encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.\n\nThe `Content-Disposition` header will be \"attachment\" to prevent\nbrowsers from running executable files.\n\nIf the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to\nAtlassian's media services platform is returned.\n\nThe response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file\nand its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always\nreturns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the\ncommit it is on.\n\n## File meta data\n\nWhen the request for a file path includes the query parameter\n`?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket\ninstead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\n{\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n  \"commit\": {\n    \"type\": \"commit\",\n    \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      },\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"attributes\": [],\n  \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nFile objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of\npossible modifiers. Currently defined values are:\n\n* `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents\n    of the file represent the path the link points to.\n* `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.\n* `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or\n    subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository\n    pointed to.\n* `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.\n\nThis endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be\nused to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without\nincurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.\n\n\n## Directory listings\n\nWhen `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a\npaginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the\nunderlying SCM system would return them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests\n{\n  \"pagelen\": 10,\n  \"values\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n      \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"attributes\": [],\n      \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n      \"size\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"page\": 1,\n  \"size\": 2\n}\n```\n\nWhen listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a\ntrailing slash at the end of the URL is required.\n\nThe response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of\na path are returned. The response does not recurse down into\nsubdirectories. In order to \"walk\" the entire directory tree, the\nclient can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each\n`commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.\n\nThe max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories\nup to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of\nfile system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too\nlarge, the call will time out and return a 555.\n\nEach returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,\nboth of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path\nfrom the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`\nobject which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely\nthe commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last\nmodified the file.\n\nDirectory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the\npaginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand\nreturns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n  \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"commit\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\n## Querying, filtering and sorting\n\nLike most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket\nquerying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing\nto only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to\nlist all binary files over 1kb use the expression:\n\n`size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"`\n\nwhich after urlencoding yields the query string:\n\n`?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`\n\nTo change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:\n\n`.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`\n\nSee [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering) for more\ndetails.",

        "description": "Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.\n\nSnippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are\nsupported.\n\nThe simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:\n\n    $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png\n\nCreating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so let's look\nat a more complicated scenario.\n\nSnippets are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`\nand `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation of\nsnippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text\nand binary files.\n\nThe main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding\nfor the meta data (currently JSON).\n\n\nmultipart/related (RFC-2387)\n----------------------------\n\nThis is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.\n\n    POST /2.0/snippets/evzijst HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 1188\n    Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-ID: snippet\n\n    {\n      \"title\": \"My snippet\",\n      \"is_private\": true,\n      \"scm\": \"hg\",\n      \"files\": {\n          \"foo.txt\": {},\n          \"image.png\": {}\n        }\n    }\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n    Content-ID: \"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n\n    foo\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: image/png\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n    Content-ID: \"image.png\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"image.png\"\n\n    iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAoCAYAAAD+MdrbAAABD0lEQVR4Ae3VMUoDQRTG8ccUaW2m\n    TKONFxArJYJamCvkCnZTaa+VnQdJSBFl2SMsLFrEWNjZBZs0JgiL/+KrhhVmJRbCLPx4O+/DT2TB\n    cbblJxf+UWFVVRNsEGAtgvJxnLm2H+A5RQ93uIl+3632PZyl/skjfOn9Gvdwmlcw5aPUwimG+NT5\n    EnNN036IaZePUuIcK533NVfal7/5yjWeot2z9ta1cAczHEf7I+3J0ws9Cgx0fsOFpmlfwKcWPuBQ\n    73Oc4FHzBaZ8llq4q1mr5B2mOUCt815qYR8eB1hG2VJ7j35q4RofaH7IG+Xrf/PfJhfmwtfFYoIN\n    AqxFUD6OMxcvkO+UfKfkOyXfKdsv/AYCHMLVkHAFWgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\n    --===============1438169132528273974==--\n\nThe request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.\n\nThe first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's\nproperties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the\nrequest's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to\npoint to it.\n\nThe remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.\nEach file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through\nwhich the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value\nshould be the name of the file.\n\n`Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's\noptional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name\nthat Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,\n`filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.\n\nWhen the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are\nnot ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its\nname was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is\nmandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).\n\n\nmultipart/form-data\n-------------------\n\nThe use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can\nalso be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional\n`multipart/form-data` request:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title=\"My snippet\"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png\n\n    POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 951\n    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Type: text/plain\n\n    foo\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"image.png\"\n    Content-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n    ?PNG\n\n    IHDR?1??I.....\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\"\n\n    My snippet\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--\n\nHere the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form\nfields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach\nmultiple files, simply repeat the field.\n\nThe advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is\nthat it can be easier to build clients.\n\nEssentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.\n\n\nSharing and Visibility\n----------------------\n\nSnippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well\nas anonymous users), or private (visible only to the owner, creator\nand members of the team in case the snippet is owned by a team). This\nis controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:\n\n* **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view\n  the snippet\n* **is_private=true** -- only the owner and team members (for team\n  snippets) can view it\n\nTo create the snippet under a team account, just append the team name\nto the URL (see `/2.0/snippets/{username}`).",

        "description": "Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to\nchange a snippet's title.\n\nTo update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the\nparts that need to be changed.\n\nThe contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the\nrequest remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently\nmanipulated with differential payloads.\n\nTo delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in\nthe request, but omit its value (use `null`).\n\nAs in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to\nrename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can\nbe done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to\nthe SCM.\n\nPUT supports three different content types for both request and\nresponse bodies:\n\n* `application/json`\n* `multipart/related`\n* `multipart/form-data`\n\nThe content type used for the request body can be different than that\nused for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP\nheaders.\n\nUse the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired\nrequest and response format.\n\n\napplication/json\n----------------\n\nAs with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what\nproperties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support\nfile contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.\n\nTo update the title, without changing any of its files:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{\"title\": \"Updated title\"}'\n\n\nTo delete the title:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{\"title\": null}'\n\nNot all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator\nfor instance are immutable.\n\n\nmultipart/related\n-----------------\n\n`multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's\nproperties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from\nthe request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,\nthe mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical\nto `application/json` requests.\n\nTo update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its\ntitle:\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 288\n    Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-ID: snippet\n\n    {\n      \"title\": \"My updated snippet\",\n      \"files\": {\n          \"foo.txt\": {}\n        }\n    }\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n    Content-ID: \"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n\n    Updated file contents.\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==--\n\nHere only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The\nother files remain untouched.\n\nNote the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains\nthe files that are being manipulated. This list should have\ncorresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents\nof these files.\n\nIf a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,\nit will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 188\n    Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-ID: snippet\n\n    {\n      \"files\": {\n        \"image.png\": {}\n      }\n    }\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==--\n\nTo simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under\nanother name:\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 212\n    Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-ID: snippet\n\n    {\n        \"files\": {\n          \"foo.txt\": {},\n          \"bar.txt\": {}\n        }\n    }\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n    Content-ID: \"bar.txt\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"bar.txt\"\n\n    foo\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==--\n\n\nmultipart/form-data\n-----------------\n\nAgain, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file\ncontents and meta data atomically.\n\n    $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title=\"My updated snippet\" -F file=@foo.txt\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 351\n    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Type: text/plain\n\n    foo\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\"\n\n    My updated snippet\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n\nTo delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the\n`files` field:\n\n    $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 149\n    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------ef8871065a86\n\n    ------------------------------ef8871065a86\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"files\"\n\n    image.png\n    ------------------------------ef8871065a86--\n\nThe explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and\n`multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.\nThe default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,\nregardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a\nconvenience to the client.",

This means that an empty `__init__.py` always\nreturns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the\ncommit it is on.\n\n#### File meta data\n\nWhen the request for a file path includes the query parameter\n`?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket\ninstead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\n{\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n  \"commit\": {\n    \"type\": \"commit\",\n    \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      },\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"attributes\": [],\n  \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nFile objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of\npossible modifiers. Currently defined values are:\n\n* `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents\n    of the file represent the path the link points to.\n* `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.\n* `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or\n    subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository\n    pointed to.\n* `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.\n\nThis endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be\nused to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without\nincurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.\n\n\n#### Directory listings\n\nWhen `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a\npaginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the\nunderlying SCM system would return them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests\n{\n  \"pagelen\": 10,\n  \"values\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n      \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"attributes\": [],\n      \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n      \"size\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"page\": 1,\n  \"size\": 2\n}\n```\n\nWhen listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a\ntrailing slash at the end of the URL is required.\n\nThe response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of\na path are returned. The response does not recurse down into\nsubdirectories. In order to \"walk\" the entire directory tree, the\nclient can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each\n`commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.\n\nThe max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories\nup to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of\nfile system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too\nlarge, the call will time out and return a 555.\n\nEach returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,\nboth of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path\nfrom the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`\nobject which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely\nthe commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last\nmodified the file.\n\nDirectory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the\npaginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand\nreturns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n  \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"commit\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\n#### Querying, filtering and sorting\n\nLike most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket\nquerying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing\nto only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to\nlist all binary files over 1kb use the expression:\n\n`size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"`\n\nwhich after urlencoding yields the query string:\n\n`?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`\n\nTo change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:\n\n`.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`\n\nSee [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more\ndetails.",
